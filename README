This application has been developed in Qt/C++ with POSIX-based threads and aims to simulate one or more closed loop control systems running simultaneously. 

In addition, users are able to manipulate gains and references in the system as well as request values generated by any component. 

A visual interface will also be developed to improve interactions between users and control systems.
